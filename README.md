# ioBroker.knx

This adapter provides an interface to a KNX bus system via eibd: http://www.auto.tuwien.ac.at/~mkoegler/index.php/eibd

eibd in turn connects to a physical KNX interface like an IP Gateway or Router, USB KNX interfaces or direct TP
interfaces (TPUARTS)

ioBroker.knx talks to eibd using it's proprietary network protocol (not to be confused with EIBnet/IP) using the
node-eibd module: https://github.com/andreek/node-eibd

NOTE: This adapter is currently INCOMPLETE and DYSFUNCTIONAL. Do NOT attempt to use it, it will turn you
into a hamster.
